Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- We found that vehicle weight and ground clearance are the two variables in our dataset that had a non-random affect on mpg. We determined this by looking at the p-values, both of which are far below our significance level of 0.05.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- The slope of the linear model is not zero, since there is a positive correlation due to the variance of the residuals is greater than 0.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

- While this model does an okay job of predicting fuel efficiencty, it is only accurate around 70% of the time (Multiple R^2 = 0.7032). Therefore, it is a functional model, but should be taken with a grain of salt to account for the 30% of the time it is not accurate.

Suspension Coil Summary

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.
Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-19.4701  -4.4994  -0.0692   5.4433  18.5849 

The variance of the suspension coils is within specification according to the summary table. The spec call for 100
and the var is 62.29 which is well within spec.

Suspension Coil T-Test


		One Sample t-test

data:  suspension$PSI
t = -0.65784, df = 149, p-value = 0.5117
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1498.122 1500.940
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1499.531 

Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level.
Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

Design Your Own Study

We can take a random sample of similar size cars of other brands and perfom a
Two-Sample-t-Test to study MPG efficiency differences between the Mechacar and other brands.

Is the MechaCar MPG efficiency statistically signficantly different from other brands?

Our null and alternative hypothesis are as follows...

H0 : There is no statistical difference between the two observed sample means.
Ha : There is a statistical difference between the two observed sample means.

The data that needs to be collected are the MPG data for both the Mecha Car as well as the brands of interest.
A population mean must also be calculated which can be from a dataset of multiple brands of cars.
